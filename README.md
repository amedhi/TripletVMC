A VMC program implementing Pfaffian wavefunction formalism for 
general pairing state (triplet or singlet). The core code is model and 
lattice geometry independent. Hence it can be adapted to work with 
arbitrary lattice geometry and Hamiltonian. It is easy to add a new model 
or a lattice, a new physical observable for measurement or a new input 
parameter for the program.
